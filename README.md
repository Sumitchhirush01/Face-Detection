# Face-Detection
In this computer vision Artificial Intelligence project and I used OpenCV Python Library and CascadeClassifier which is already trained model and help in to detect the face in saved photo or video and in live video.

1. Imports
2. Initialize the classifier
3. Apply faceCascade on webcam frames
4. Release the capture frames

Summary:
In this deep learning project, we developed a model for real-time human face recognition with python and opencv.
